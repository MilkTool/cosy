# Wish list

* Null-safety
* Immutable-by-default (e.g. introduce a `mut` keyword)
* Compile-time error to redefine variable/function
* No semi-colons?
* Change assignment to be a statement instead of an expression?
* No variable shadowing allowed (does this have unforseen consequences?)
* Everything is an expression (because it's easier)
* Avoid local function variables overwriting function arguments (e.g. `var a = "local"`)
* Static analysis for
    * Dead code
* Class functions cannot override other functions (must be uniquely named)
* for-loop without sugaring (makes output code ugly)
* Strong types by requiring variables to be initialized
* Replace classes with structs, interfaces, traits and member-functions

# Project wishlist
* Enable null-safety feature for Haxe
* Unit tests
* Simple CI?
* VSCode tasks

## Long shots
* Built-in ECS functionality somehow
* Easy to integrate C/C++ libraries
* Yield as a language construct
* Built-in threading
